WARNING
this repo is missing the sqlite3 database you will need to run the news app. Since it is over 100mb in size, it cannot be uploaded to github. I will be adding a download link soon!

GETTING STARTED
head to the terminal and go to the root folder of this project. Next you will want to install the required packages. Enter the command "pip3 install requirements.txt".

Once this is complete, the next command you will enter is "python3 manage.py runserver" which will start up your local server. It should output a message letting you know what URL to use in your browser.

OPTIONAL
Replace the empty db.sqlite3 file that comes from github and replace it with the production db which can be found at a URL soon...
