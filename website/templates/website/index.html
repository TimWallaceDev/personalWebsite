        <h1 class="text-center display-4 padding">Tim Wallace . ca ya!</h1>
        <p>Hey! Thanks for checking out my website! My name is Tim Wallace and I am currently a freelance web designer. If you need a website of any kind, dont hesitate to reach out at timwallacedev@gmai.com to set up a consultation. Also check out examples of my work in the portfolio section below.</p>

        <!--Personal Projects-->

        <h2>Portfolio</h2>

        <h3>Tasks</h3>
        <p>The quitecential project for any dev is the task app. Getting user input to update the dom is really the heart of any website. I built this site using only javascript, HTML and CSS. I thought a cool use for the localStorage would be a little task list. With large modern internet companies hoovering up any data users may present them, having ownership of your own data is becoming increasingly important for some. I wanted to create a task app that would never be able to track anyones data and that privacy concious individuals would want to use.</p>

        <h3>E-Bike Stats</h3>
        <p>Living in Toronto, getting from place to place in the city is a nightmare. Cars are too expensive, not to mention the headache of finding a parking spot. The TTC is too slow and unreliable. Uber rides are almost as expensive as owning a car. Since I moved here for university, I've primarily been getting around on my bicycle. Being a dedicated cyclist, I was very interested when E-Bikes started to hit the market. I really wanted to buy one, however they are quite the investment and wanted to be sure that any bike I bought would be able to last for years. Finding reviews for brand new products is easy, but finding long term reviews putting bikes through their paces were few and far between. The goal of this site was for E-Bike owners to share their long term experiences with others in order to help them make smarter comsumer choices.</p>

        <h3>Auctions</h3>
        <p>This website was a course project for an online course I took (EdX CS50).  It was built using the Django framework. The main focus of this assignment was to learn about Object models and relational data. This means moving away from running SQL queries inside of the code that may allow bad actors to inject malicious queries into your code. I learned a lot during this assignment.</p>

        <h3>Stocks Simulator</h3>
        <p>This assignment I very much enjoyed building. At the time I was building it, Gamestop was at the height meme status. The price was over $200 a share and stocks were on the top of everyones mind. Seemingly everybody knew that they had missed out on a crazy oportunity and were somewhat eager to find the next. Some of the code was already written for us. For example the basic layout and function for looking up the current price of a stock (given as an argument to the function) was already built for us.</p>

    <!--Freelance Projects-->

    <h2>Freelance Projects</h2>

    <h3>Human Magic</h3>
    <p>This website was my first freelance project. I built it for a local Toronto band called 'Human Magic'. This was their main website to show off their content</p>

    <h3>Celler Sessions</h3>
    This was another project for 'Human Magic'. This project was an offshoot of cover songs which they wanted to have some separation from their original music.

    <h3>Tom n' Petes</h3>
    <p>This website I built for a local landscaping startup. It was a simple brochure site with their services, prices and contact information.</p>

    <h3>Jerry's Farm</h3>
    <p>This website was built for a local Farmer/Landscaper. This is also mostly a brochure site with a CMS for Jerry to update his current inventory and pricing. </p>

    <!--About this website-->

    <h2>About this website</h2>
    <p>This website is a bit of an experiment for me. I use it almost as a playground to and deploy new things I've built. After learning basic HTML and CSS some time ago, I was desperate to get my little websites live on the world wide web. I found Neocities, a static site host with great monthly fees and all the features you would want. You could add your own custom domain and they would provide you with an SSL certificate. Everything was super easy!

    Then I got into backend.....

    I learned of a whole new world with servers and scripts. I wanted in. So I got myself a raspberry pi and got to work. I learned about Apache, Port Forwarding, SSL certificates and more. 

    My website is still hosting on that same raspberry pi today. I'm running an apache server which is hosting my Django project for my personal site. The nice thing about Django is that you can add as many apps as you want. This kind of modjularity is super neat.
